The problem of sample efficiany is addressed via a noval approach to the maximal entropy Reinforcement learning replacing the manual tunning of the temperature (traditionally set namually for each task) with a constraint on the entropy and solving the constraint problem with a dual Lagrangian method. The approach is implemented on a small quadropedal robot which achives acceptable performance within 2 hour of training (~400 rollouts) with no pre-training in simulation.

### [Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion over Challenging Terrain, 2020](/Motion_Planning_Quadropedal/RL_Based/Learning%20Quadrupedal%20Locomotion%20over%20Challenging%20Terrain.pdf)
This seminal paper is the brought to light the abbility to used RL method for complex motion planning tasks. The main result of this work is a highly robust controller for a quadropedal robot based solely on prioperceptive sensors capable of traversing extremly challenging terrains. It is this controller that wa used by cerberus team to win the DARPA subterenious challenge.
The main noval components are:
- **A novel teacher-student learning architectue** in which the teacher network learns both a latent space embedding and a policy via an RL method and the student learns the same elements (different architecture-TCN) learned with imitation learning in which the input to the embedding in a sequence of preoperceptive observations.
- **Curriculem learning**
- **Low level deployement of the policy**

### [RMA: Rapid Motor Adaptation for Legged Robots, 2021](/Motion_Planning_Quadropedal/RL_Based/RMA%20Rapid%20Motor%20Adaptation%20for%20Legged%20Robots.pdf)

![RMA Architecture](/Motion_Planning_Quadropedal/RL_Based/RMA.png){:width="600px"}.

This paper introduces the adaptation modual which may be seen as a system identification module for the enviroment physical parameters. The adaptation mudule learnes the latent enviromental factor encoding via supervised learning taking as an input a trajectory of robot states. 
Some key notions:
- The enviriment parameters include both terrain properties an robot parameters such as mass, C.O.M and Actuator parameters. 
- The base policy achived in the priveledge learning stage is the same as the one in the deployment, yet due to the fact that the adaptation learning is only exposed to good trajectories and so is the base policy, both are retrained (iteratevly) with online data untill convergence.
- The Adaptation mudule and the base policy are significantly different (in size and function) making the adaptation module not suited for high frequency inference, thus an asynchronous deployment is implemented.
- Training is completely performed in Simulation.

The basic premiss of this work is that velocity commands may be too restrictive from a policy design perspective in order to explore the whole action space. The velocity commands are replaced with position command given in a radius of 5[m] of the robot, it is noted that no position observation exists -- this issue is not discussed. The reward structure is split into 4 main components
1. Primary reward to reaching the requested goal -- recived only at the end.
2. Penalties for motion regularization.
3. Prelimranery assisted velocity reward to establish a reward signal. Only applicable at the start of training.
4. An exploration reward (to avoid to robot to stand still).

The policy performance, especially in non conventional situations, is greatly improved, it learnes to climbe and jump however there are some limitation as it is most likley favor a right/left leaning gate pattern and the policy training has increased instabilaty.
For deployment, the velocity commands generated by the user where used to generate a syntetic pos target, two methods were tested mainly on how control the velocity magnitude.

This work  applies the same principle of teacher-student framwork in order to enable extreem manuvers. The teacher is learned with sampeled hight map and in addition an "expert" direction for the manuver. 
The student policy, learned by imitaion, takes as an input both the robot state and an head facing depth camera and the output is the estimated expert direction and the latent enviroment estimation.
In addition the work presents a simple reward function structure, in particular for the jap jump.

[Project page](https://junfeng-long.github.io/HIMLoco/)

The HIM (Hybrid Internal Model) motion control architecture takes insperation from the Internal Mode Control applied in classical control theory. The method adds an intrnal model of the system which outputs a latent next step estimation of the robot which is then fed into the policy to obtain the next action. 
The critic is exposed to priveledge knowledge (higth map and external forces) while the Internal Model (Source incoder) is exposed to a trajectory of Proprioceptive states.
The Internal nodel is trained with a form of contrastive learning.
In all this is a highly robust yet seems overly convoluded, in addition the current from does not include any etraproceptive observation (e.g., camera) however they may be easily integrated.

### [Deep Compliant Control for Legged Robots, 2024](/Motion_Planning_Quadropedal/RL_Based/Deep%20Compliant%20Control%20for%20Legged%20Robots.pdf)

This work represents a compliant control mechanism learned by a multistgae episoidc RL framework. Each episode contains three stages:
- Walking stage: Learn to walk undisturbed for 2 sec.
- Recovery stage: A disturbance is introduced to the simulation via velocity impulse input to the robot base, at this stage (for 1 sec) the reward for the base linear and angular velocity is replace with the avarage reward returned in the learning stage (No penalty).
- Post-recovery stage: the full reward term is returned making sure the robot resumes it course.

The resulting policy is shown to be not only more complient w.r.t. external disturbance but also better behaved when incountering dynamic obstacles and dealing with uneven/unstable terrain.

Lior: We could use the internal model approach and augment the reward structure to achive this complient behaviour.

 A well writen paper which can be seen as a dirct followup work to the 2022 [paper](/Motion_Planning_Quadropedal/RL_Based/Advanced%20Skills%20by%20Learning%20Locomotion%20and%20Local%20Navigation.pdf). The same setup of navigation task replaces the velocity commands with some additional enviroment artipacts to achive the Left-Right Symmetry. At first a general sparce terrain walking policy is learned in order achive a good base line and at a second stage new policies are distilled on specialized terrain using the initial policy as an initial point.

This paper takes the RL approach to quadroped locomotion, realizing  the different motion gait are suitable to different terrain type and velocity two policies are designe.
The first is a locomotion policy which outputs the motion actions. The input to the locomotion policy is the velocity command concatenated with the policy selection, an integer [0,7].
The policy selection if the output if the policy selection policy which selects which gait parameters to apply. While the locomotion policy has a standart reward function the policy selection policy has an interesting structure as the parameters for the gait transition 
in the wild are not well defined, a primary discriminant is the CoT measure.
The paper makes use on additional structure such as a state estimator and and gate generator process which serves as a referance for the locomotion policy.
The work is done in RaiSim.

This work aims to deal with blind (proprioceptive) walking using a modified teacher student policy (Probability Anealing Selection). The task is framed a locomotion/navigation problem with position command, however, the reward structure is dence (not sparce) as the objective is to deal with small maneuvers. 
It is unclear to me (lior) how the trap classification is generated in the stage 1 learning yet in stage 2 it is learned as an extended privladge information.
