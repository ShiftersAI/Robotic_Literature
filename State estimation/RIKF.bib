  abstract = {Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system’s trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts, and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric versions. We compare the convergence of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) through both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot. Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment provides a practical use case. Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in system.},

  abstract  = {The Kalman filter—or, more precisely, the extended Kalman filter (EKF)—is a fundamental engineering tool that is pervasively used in control and robotics and for various estimation tasks in autonomous systems. The recently developed field of invariant extended Kalman filtering uses the geometric structure of the state space and the dynamics to improve the EKF, notably in terms of mathematical guarantees. The methodology essentially applies in the fields of localization, navigation, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Although it was created only recently, its remarkable robustness properties have already motivated a real industrial implementation in the aerospace field. This review aims to provide an accessible introduction to the methodology of invariant Kalman filtering and to allow readers to gain insight into the relevance of the method as well as its important differences with the conventional EKF. This should be of interest to readers intrigued by the practical application of mathematical theories and those interested in finding robust, simple-to-implement filters for localization, navigation, and SLAM, notably for autonomous vehicle guidance.},
